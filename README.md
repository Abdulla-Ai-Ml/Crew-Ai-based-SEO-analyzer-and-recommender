AI-powered SEO Analysis System using CrewAI, Bright Data, and Groq LLaMA3.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
The idea was to create an intelligent agent that can scrape websites, analyze their SEO performance, and generate actionable recommendations in a structured report format.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack & Workflow

CrewAI â†’ Orchestrates agents, tasks, and workflows

Bright Data Scraper â†’ Scrapes and renders dynamic website content with API integration

Groq LLaMA3 (deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) â†’ LLM used for semantic understanding & structured SEO reporting

Streamlit â†’ Interactive UI to input website URLs and display reports in real-time

ðŸ”¹ How it Works

User provides a website URL.

Bright Data API scrapes the content.

SEO Agent (CrewAI) analyzes the data using LLaMA3 with a structured prompt.

The model evaluates:

Basic Info: Titles, meta descriptions, headers

Content Quality: Word count, keyword usage, readability

On-Page SEO: Title tags, alt text, internal linking, URLs

Technical SEO: Page speed, mobile-friendliness, sitemap, robots.txt

Backlinks (if visible)

Competitor Benchmark Suggestions

Generates a scored SEO report (On-Page, Technical, Content) with final recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Project Matters
Most SEO audits today are either fully manual or limited to surface-level tools. By leveraging multi-agent AI + web scraping, this approach delivers real-time, in-depth analysis that can scale across industries like:

Digital Marketing Agencies

E-commerce Platforms

Competitive Benchmarking Tools

ðŸ”¹ Key Learnings

How to integrate multi-agent systems with real-world APIs (Bright Data).

Deploying Groqâ€™s optimized inference with LLaMA3 for faster, cost-effective analysis.

Designing structured prompts for reliable report generation.

Building end-to-end apps with CrewAI + Streamlit.

This was an exciting step in combining RAG-like pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, and practical SEO insights into one cohesive project.

Iâ€™m looking forward to extending this further â€” maybe adding competitor multi-site benchmarking or YouTube/Blog SEO integration into the pipeline.
